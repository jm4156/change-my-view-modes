<title>CMV: Veganism and vegetarianism are not the best way to improve farm animal welfare</title>

<OP author="Helicase21">
Title is mostly to get attention, and I'm working from a specific set of assumptions. My argument is as follows:

1) <claim> The chances of the entire world adopting a vegan/vegetarian diet are slim to none </claim>

1a) Therefore, <claim> there will always be a market for meat and other animal products </claim>

2) <claim> The food market, like all other markets, operates on general principles of supply and demand </claim>

3) <claim> Meat farmers can use techniques exhibiting a range of costs or benefits, both in terms of environmental impact and animal welfare. </claim>

4) <claim> A vegan or vegetarian diet denies demand, and thus potential revenue, to all meat-producing farms, regardless of how humane or environmentally sound their practice are. </claim>

 4a) <argument> Since the majority of farms are large factory farms </argument>, <claim> I concede that this is probably good for animal welfare. </claim> **However**:

5)  <claim> Purchasing meat from farms known to produce their meat in an ethical way not only denies demand to large factory farms </claim> but <claim> helps improve the market share of ethical meat-growing </claim>, <claim> which seems as though it would be even better for animal welfare. </claim>

<claim> My general view is that people should probably as a rule eat less meat from better growers <claim>, and <claim> that will make for a bigger shift in growing practices than simply people dropping out of eating meat altogether. </claim> Moreover, <argument> this practice would be much easier to "evangelize" than a vegetarian or vegan diet. </argument> <argument> Face it, meat is tasty (and non-factory meat is often tastier than factory-farmed meat, at least in my own anecdotal experience) </argument>

<claim> Vegans decide not to eat meat because they want to make a statement about something they believe in, not necessarily because they want to improve animal welfare </claim>. (although <claim> they likely do want to improve animal welfare </claim>) Let me explain:

<claim> As you already pointed out, becoming a vegan has little to no affect on animal welfare. </claim> <argument> People will always want meat and the market will always provide it. </argument> <argument> Vegan that truly believes that they are directly helping animals by not eating meat are deluding themselves. </argument> You are correct on this point.

So why do vegans decide to be vegans, if not to directly help animals? 

 <claim> Most vegans eat their burgers without beef because they want to make a statement. </claim> <argument> "I believe that animals are being treated cruelly. because of this, I will not eat meat." </argument> <argument> It's a bit like not going to a restaurant because they came out against a belief of yours. </argument> <argument> If you believe in gay rights, you may decide not to go to chick-fil-a because of your belief. </argument> <argument> Do you really believe that you not giving business will help in any way? </argument> <argument> no, you don't. You just want to make a statement. </argument>

TL;DR: You are correct, but you misinterpret the true motivation of vegans 

Hope that helps.

 <claim> I don't think I'm misinterpreting the motivations of vegans. </claim> <argument> I know from personal experience that people go vegan/vegetarian for a huge variety of reasons, from personal health to carbon footprint to animal welfare to ethics of eating meat to budget (meat is expensive). </argument>

<claim> Your OP implied that you thought the purpose of veganism is was to improve animal welfare. </claim> Forgive me if I misinterpreted you. 

&gt; <quote> that people go vegan/vegetarian for a huge variety of reasons, from personal health to carbon footprint to animal welfare to ethics of eating meat to budget (meat is expensive). <quote>

 Yes, these are all other reasons that people go into veganism. However, since <argument> (I thought) your post pertained to the "Vegans are vegans because they hate the state of animal welfare," reasoning </argument>, I made my post primarily about the relationship between vegans and animal welfare.
